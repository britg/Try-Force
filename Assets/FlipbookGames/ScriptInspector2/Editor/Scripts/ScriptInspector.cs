/* SCRIPT INSPECTOR 2
 * version 2.1.9, May 2014
 * Copyright © 2012-2014, Flipbook Games
 * 
 * Unity's legendary custom inspector for C#, UnityScript and Boo scripts,
 * now transformed into a powerful Script, Shader, and Text Editor!!!
 * 
 * NOTE TO UNITY 4 USERS:
 * This package has been exported from Unity 3.5.6 to allow using it in earlier
 * versions of Unity. Unity 4 has different set of properties for Font assets and
 * fonts imported from Unity 3 packages do not give the best results in Unity 4.
 * In order to make the text in Script Inspector 2 crisp and more readable after
 * importing this package you should set the import settings for all fonts
 * located in Assets/FlipbookGames/ScriptInspector2/Editor/EditorResources to use
 * the Dynamic font rendering and rendering mode to be Hinted Smooth.
