SCRIPT INSPECTOR 2
version 2.1.9, May 2014
Copyright © 2012-2014, Flipbook Games
--------------------------------

Unity's legendary custom inspector for C#, UnityScript and Boo scripts, now transformed into a powerful Script, Shader, and Text Editor!!!


NOTE TO UNITY 4 USERS:
This package has been exported from Unity 3.5.6 to allow using it in earlier versions of Unity. Unity 4 has different set of properties for Font assets and fonts imported from Unity 3 packages do not give the best results in Unity 4. In order to make the text in Script Inspector 2 crisp and more readable after importing this package you should set the import settings for all fonts located in Assets/FlipbookGames/ScriptInspector2/Editor/EditorResources to use the Dynamic font rendering and rendering mode to be Hinted Smooth.

1. Description

SCRIPT INSPECTOR 2 is the latest HUGE improvement of that legendary editor extension for Unity which you've been using so far only as a quick and fancy viewer for your scripts, now transformed into a powerful script, shader and text assets editor embedded right inside the Unity Editor!

Built with performance in mind since the beginning while keeping the quality at the highest standards, it was gradually growing with new features, to finally become the fastest and most comfortable solution for programmers to write their scripts from inside Unity. Although at this stage it still cannot rival the most advanced external programming applications, neither can fully replace their original purpose, Script Inspector 2 using its greatest advantage, being integrated inside Unity, is definitely a great tool for improving programmer’s workflow, fulfilling their everyday basic needs. Accessibility combined with quick iteration cycles achieved with Script Inspector 2 makes this extension the preferred script editor for any Unity programmer including myself, the author. As a result of that addiction considerable amount of work, especially in the finalizing stage during development of this extension was done in it, making Script Inspector 2 the first Unity extension programmed in itself! ;)


2. Motivation

After surprising popularity of all of the previous versions of Script Inspector and by popular demand for adding at least some basic editing functionality to it, Script Inspector was transformed into a script editor that’s not only a handy and nice tool for fixing typos or closing forgotten parentheses, but also a really solid script editor strong enough to support professional game development and to be used in real projects.


3. How to use the Script Inspector 2

First thing you will notice when you start using Script Inspector 2 is the SI Console tab which opens automatically and docks next to Unity’s default Console tab. You can also open it manually from the Window menu, select Window->Script Inspector Console and the new SI Console tab will dock next to the Console tab. SI Console works exactly the same as the original console with the only difference that on double-click or Enter/Return key it opens the associated script or shader with the selected log entry in a Si2 tab instead of opening it in the external IDE. You can still open log entries in the external IDE from the standard Console tab.

Whenever a text asset or a C#, JavaScript, or Boo script asset is selected in Unity Editor, the Inspector tab displays the whole content of the script in a way typical for viewing code or text files, with syntax highlighting, optional word-wrapping, proper tab expansion and alignment, optional line numbers, and with underlined hyperlinks for single-click navigation. In addition Script Inspector 2 allows script or text assets editing inside the Inspector or in dedicated script/text editor tabs. It also allows editing shader assets in dedicated script editor tabs.

To open a script, shader, or text asset in dedicated editor tabs there are a couple of options. One of them is to follow a log entry from the SI Console, as mentioned before. From the SI Console you can also see the call stack on some entries and navigate to any of those locations from the context popup menu on log entries. Another way to open scripts, shaders, and text assets is to use the New Tab toolbar button in the upper left corner of any script or text asset displayed in the Inspector tab or dedicated script, shader, and text editor tabs (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T, or ⌘T on Mac). Script editor tabs (Si2 tabs) can be arranged, docked, undocked, maximized, or closed as the regular Unity tabs, and even saved and restored with editor Layouts.

You can open additional script, shader, or text assets into a particular tab group by dragging the assets from the Project tab to one of the existing Si2 tabs. You can also drag Materials to open the shader used in them directly. Similarly you can drag GameObjects from the current scene or prefabs to open their components based on MonoBehaviour scripts. Component scripts can also be easily accessed from the component’s wrench menus in the Inspector. You similarly open shaders used in materials from the wrench menu of the Inspector.

The Script Inspector 2 can optionally open a new Si2 tab or focus an existing tab for script, shader, or text assets by double-clicking them in the Project tab. These options (turned off by default) are located in the wrench menu of any of the script/text editor views. Pressing Enter (Command-Down Arrow on Mac) on the selected asset in the Project tab would still open them in the external IDE, so you still have that option available.

Script, shader, and text assets can be opened in multiple Script Inspector views at the same time showing different parts of their content with different caret position and selection, but the editing is synchronized. Changes made in one of these tabs are immediately visible in the other tabs. The Undo/Redo buffer is also shared so that changes made in tab can be reverted in another one, for example.

Script Inspector 2 holds unlimited Undo/Redo buffers for each edited asset independently. These buffers are also independent of the Unity’s built-in undo buffer, so that changes in scripts don’t interfere with the changes made in the rest of Unity and each can be reverted or repeated independently. There are Undo and Redo toolbar buttons in each script/text editor view, and there are keyboard shortcuts associated with them – Ctrl+Shift+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Y on Windows and ⌃Z and ⇧⌃Z on OS X for Undo and Redo respectively.

Script Inspector 2 handles very wide range of mouse and keyboard interactions, providing the users with an experience similar to modern IDE’s. Cursor navigation, selecting words, selecting lines, Cut/Copy/Paste, drag selections, dragging selected text to move or copy, search functionality, quick search, are only some of the features implemented in Script Inspector 2. Since version 2.1 there are also shortcuts for closing Si2 tabs, switching between Si2 tabs within a dock group, and for rearranging the tabs. See the Shortcuts section for a more complete list of included features.

Optionally script/text editor view can display line numbers and track changes indicators, which can be turned on or off from the wrench toolbar button. Additionally from that button you can choose a color scheme for code syntax highlighting or for the text assets, and the font used for displaying the content. The About box can also be accessed through the wrench button menu.

All hyperlinks found in the comments of the script or anywhere in the text assets will be shown as underlined clickable links and also listed in the Links toolbar button drop-down menu so you can easily open any of them directly from there.


4. Saving and Reloading

Script Inspector 2 keeps track of all changes made using it. Asterisk signs in Si2 tab’s titles indicate unsaved changed. You can save the changes with the Save toolbar button or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+S on Windows or ⌥⌘S on OS X. All modified assets will be automatically saved before entering the game mode.

Navigating away from a modified asset in the Inspector or closing the last open Si2 tab for that asset will warn you and asking if you want to save the changes made in the asset, discard them, or keep them in memory to continue with editing later. You’ll also get similar warnings on quitting the Editor or loading another Unity project, just without the option to keep the changes in memory, of course.

After saving the changes made in Script Inspector 2 the Unity will compile them as usual and display all compile warnings and errors in both the Console and SI Console.

Reimported scripts, either manually or automatically as a result of external changes, will be updated in the Script Inspector views automatically. Well, unless those scripts have been modified and not saved before reimporting, in which case the Script Inspector 2 gives you a warning and asking which version to keep.

6. Future plans

Now that the code editing functionality is implemented, the short term plan is to extend that with code navigation, code completion, parameters hints for function calls, etc.

The long term plan is to add full debugging capabilities and turn Unity into something that only the greatest AAA game engines may offer.
