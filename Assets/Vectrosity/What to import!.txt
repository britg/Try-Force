If you're using Unity 4.0 - Unity 4.2, import the Vectrosity_Unity4_0 package.

If you're using Unity 4.3 or later, import the Vectrosity_Unity4_3 package.

You can also import the VectrositySource package instead of either of the above packages, if you want to use the source code instead of a DLL. The source will work with both Unity 4.0 - 4.2 and 4.3 or later. Note that you must only import ONE of these three packages!

Any of the other packages (EditorScripts, Demos, TankZone) require one of the above packages to be imported first.
